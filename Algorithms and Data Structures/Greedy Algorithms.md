# Greedy Algorithms

A Greedy Algorithm is a technique in which the "best" possible solution to a
sub-problem, given the information available in the moment, is used. Problems
where the locally optimal solution also lead to the global solution are a good
fit for a Greedy Algorithm.

Examples:
- [[Dijkstra's]]
- [[A Star]]
- [[Prim's Algorithm]]
- [[Knapsack Problem]]
- [[Travelling Salesman Problem]]

The Greedy Algorithm always goes for the best possible choice at each step in
the algorithm. This can cause future problems and lead to inefficient solutions.
