# Hash Map (Dictionary)

A hash map (or dictionary) is a data structure that maps keys to values.
The hash map passes the key through a hash function to compute an index. That
index corresponds to an array location containg a bucket from which the value
can be found.

> [!tip] The average lookup time complexity of a hash map is O(1).

A hash map can be thought of as a structure on top of an array that enables the
use of flexible keys instead of strictly sequential integer indices.

## Set
A set is a data structure that stores unique values without an order. A
set is similar to a dictionary with only keys and no values.
