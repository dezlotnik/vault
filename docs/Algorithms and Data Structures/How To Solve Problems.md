## Understanding a Computational Problem
A problem is defined by a set of possible inputs and their relationship to the desired output.

Example, given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days.

1. Don't panic!
2. What are the inputs?
3. What are the outputs?
4. Work through some examples by hand. What's the relationship between the inputs and outputs?
5. Try and develop a simple mechanical solution (don't optimize prematurely).
6. Develop incrementally, and test as you go.
