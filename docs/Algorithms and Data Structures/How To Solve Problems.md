# How to Solve Problems

A problem is defined by a set of possible inputs and their relationship to the
desired output.

1. Don't panic!
2. What are the inputs?
3. What are the outputs?
4. Work through some examples by hand. What's the relationship between the
inputs and outputs?
5. Try and develop a simple mechanical solution (don't optimize prematurely).
6. Develop incrementally, and test as you go.
