# Stochastic Process

> [!definition] Stochastic Process ^def-stochastic-process
> A stochastic process, denoted as $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$, is a collection of
> random variables indexed by a parameter set $T$.
>
> More formally, given a probability 
> space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, a stochastic process is a family of 
> random variables $\{X_t: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\}_{t \in T}$ defined on 
> this probability space. Here:
> * $\Omega$: Sample space, the set of all possible outcomes.
> * $\mathcal{F}$: Sigma-algebra on $\Omega$, a collection of events.
> * $\mathbb{P}$: Probability measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$.
> * $T$: Index set, often representing time.
> * $X_t$: Random variable associated with time $t$.
> 
> The index set $T$ can be discrete (e.g., natural numbers for discrete-time 
> processes) or continuous (e.g., real numbers for continuous-time processes).
