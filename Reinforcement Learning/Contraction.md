# Contraction Mapping

> [!definition] Contraction Mapping ^def-contraction-mapping
> A contraction mapping, also known as a contraction
> operator, is a function that brings points closer
> together. More formally, a function $T: X \rightarrow X$ on a metric
> space $(X, d)$ is a *contraction mapping* if there exists a
> constant $0 \le \gamma < 1$ such that:
> $$d(T(x), T(y)) ≤ γ * d(x, y)$$
> for all $x, y ∈ X$. 

In simpler terms, applying the function $T$ to two points
brings them closer together, and the factor $\gamma$ determines
the rate of contraction. This property is crucial in
various mathematical fields, including analysis, topology,
and dynamical systems.
