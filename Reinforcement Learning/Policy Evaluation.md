# Policy Evaluation

Policy evaluation is the process of determining the value function for a given
policy. In other words, it involves calculating the expected return from each
state under that specific policy. This is essential in reinforcement learning
as it allows us to assess the quality of a policy and identify areas for
improvement.

## Types of policy evaluation

### Known Model

- [[Value Iteration]]

### Unknown Model
- [[Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation]]
- [[Temporal Difference Learning]]
- [[Certainty Equivalence with Dynamic Programming]]
